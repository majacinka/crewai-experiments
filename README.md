# CREWAI experiments

------ 

For my experiments with CrewAI, I decided to try 3 different projects, starting from the easiest to the most complex. The aim of the experiments was to have a team of AI agents do following work for me:
1. Examine my Startup idea
2. Build AI newsletter with Google SERP
3. Build AI newsletter with Reddit Scraper 
4. Email classifier [WIP]

## For my experiments I've tried following LLMs:
---

### Available through API calls:

1. OpenAI -> GPT-4 
2. Gemini Pro 

### Local Models through Ollama + rating of how they performed:

1. **Mistral 7B** 
- Nice, coherent results
- Didn't understand that it should use scraping tool for the output
- Result is a bunch of generic text from training data
2. **Mistral 7B instruct** 
- Nice, coherent results, a lot of emojis
- Didn't use any scraping tool for the output
- Result is a bunch of generic text from training data.
3. **Open Chat 3.5 7B** 
- The best and most "newsletter-y" results
- But again, didn't use any tool, so generic content
4. **Nous Hermes 7B**  
- Ok results
- didn't use any tool
- generic content
5. **Open Hermes 2.5 7B** 
- The tone and style of writing is great
- but generic content
- didn't understand that it needs to use tools
6. **Starling 7B** 
- Ok results
- didn't use any tool
- generic content
7. **Llama 2 13B** 
- The only model that "understood" what the task is
- but the text wasn't coherent enough, didn's sound like a newsletter
8. **Llama 2 13B chat**  
- Didn't understand the task or produce any output
9. **Llama 2 13B text** 
- Didn't understand the task or produce any output
10. **Llama 2 7B** 
- not coherent
- didn't use any tool
- no output
11. **Llama 2 7B text** 
- No actual output
- didn't use any tool
- generic content
12. **Llama 2 7B chat** 
- Didn't use any tool
- generic content
13. **Phi-2**
